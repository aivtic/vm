Welcome to the **A-I Vocational Training Institute of Cybersecurity** Vulnerable Web Application Setup! This repository contains an automated script that installs multiple vulnerable web applications on Ubuntu for hands-on learning in web application security and penetration testing.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Automated Setup**: Quickly deploy multiple vulnerable web apps using a single script.
- **Educational Focus**: Perfect for training students in real-world security testing.
- **Vulnerable Apps Included**:
  - **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**: Learn basic and advanced web security issues.
  - **bWAPP (Buggy Web Application)**: Over 100 web vulnerabilities to explore and exploit.
  - **OWASP Juice Shop**: Modern, intentionally insecure web application for security testing.
  - **Mutillidae**: A purposefully vulnerable web app with various web vulnerabilities to learn from.

## ðŸ“œ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before running the setup script:
- **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS** (or later)
- **Git**
- **Internet Access**

## ðŸ”§ Installation

Clone this repository and run the setup script to install the web applications:
